Scratch File Reader (Read Scratch project files in Java)
========================================================

This is a simple, robust API for reading projects created in [MIT's Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) programming environment into Javaland, and encapsulating the various objects represented therein at runtime.

Eventually, this project might provide both read and write capability. Images are fully supported (i.e. the framework will create BufferedImage instances for you), but there is currently no sound support.
